\description{
Performs Williams' test for contrasting increasing (decreasing) dose levels of a treatment.
}
\details{
Williams' test is a step-down trend test for testing several treatment levels
with a zero control in a one-factorial design with normally distributed
errors of homogeneous variance. Let there be \eqn{k} groups including the control and let
the zero dose level be indicated with \eqn{i = 0} and the treatment
levels indicated as \eqn{1 \le i \le m}, then the following \eqn{m = k - 1} hypotheses are tested:

\deqn{
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{H}_{m}: \bar{x}_0 = m_1 = \ldots = m_m, & \mathrm{A}_{m}: \bar{x}_0 \ge m_1 \ge \ldots m_m, \bar{x}_0 < m_m \\
\mathrm{H}_{m-1}: \bar{x}_0 = m_1 = \ldots = m_{m-1}, & \mathrm{A}_{m-1}: \bar{x}_0 \ge m_1 \ge \ldots m_{m-1}, \bar{x}_0 < m_{m-1} \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
\mathrm{H}_{1}: \bar{x}_0 = m_1, & \mathrm{A}_{1}: \bar{x}_0 < m_1,\\
\end{array}
}

where \eqn{m_i} denotes the isotonic mean of the \eqn{i}th dose level group.
The procedure starts from the highest dose level (\eqn{m}) to the the lowest dose level (\eqn{1}) and
stops at the first non-significant test. The consequent lowest effect dose
is the treatment level of the previous test number.

The function does not return p-values. Instead the critical t-values
as given in the tables of Williams (1972) for \eqn{\alpha = 0.05} (one-sided)
are looked up according to the degree of freedoms (\eqn{v}) and the order number of the
dose level (\eqn{i}) and (potentially) modified according to the given extrapolation
coefficient \eqn{\beta}.

Non tabulated values are linearly interpolated as recommended by Williams (1972).
The function \code{\link[stats]{approx}} is used.

For the comparison of the first dose level (i = 1) with the control, the critical t-value
from the Student t distribution is used (\code{\link[stats]{TDist}}).
}
\note{
In the current implementation, only tests on the level of \eqn{\alpha = 0.05}
can be performed. The included extrapolation function assumes either
a balanced design, or designs, where the number of replicates in the control excdeeds the number of replicates
in the treatment levels. A warning message appears, if the following
condition is not met, \eqn{1 \le n_0 / n_i \le 6} for \eqn{1 \le i \le m}.
