\section{CHANGES IN PMCMRPLUS VERSION 1.4.0}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item The function \code{siegelTukeyTest} for
      performing the Siegel-Tukey rank dispersion test
      was added.
      \item The function \code{GSTTest} for
      performing the Generalized Siegel-Tukey Test
      for rank dispersion was added.
    }
  }
  \subsection{BUGFIXES}{
   \itemize{
     \item The names of columns and rows of the lower
     triangle matrix in any of the functions
     \code{frdAllPairs*}, \code{frdManyOne*} and
     \code{quadeAllPairsTest} were occasionally wrong.
     The bug only appeared, if \code{y, group, block}
     were provided as vectors and the group vector was
     sorted. This bug has been fixed.
   }
  }
    \subsection{OTHER CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Example of Rd file of \code{kruskalTest}
      was modified to show equality of Conover's F and
      one-way ANOVA F-Test with ranks.
    }
  }

\section{CHANGES IN PMCMRPLUS VERSION 1.3.0}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item The function \code{snkTest} for performing

      in function \code{powerMCtests}
      \item The funtion \code{steelTest} including
      print and summary S3-methods for applying
      Steel's Many-to-One Rank Test was added.
      \item The function \code{tamhaneT2Test} was extended

  \subsection{BUGFIXES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Several Rd files were corrected (e.g. links to other man
      files, corrected calls to functions in examples section)
      \item The function \code{tamhaneT2Test} was corrected in order
      to compute the two-tailed p-value with Sidaks p-adjustment using
      \eqn{m = k(k-1)/2}.
